# thesisblockchainrobots

file structure:
- blockchain: code, command, environment to develop, deploy a private network with smart contract
- robot:
	- blockchain warehouse: the navigator code
	- ros_multi_tb3: ROS launch files, params for both simulation and physical robot setup
- adminUI: source code of admin user interface - this code is partly reused from my other project.

There are readme files inside those directories for details.
